The internet of things, or IoT, is a network of interrelated devices that connect and exchange data with other IoT devices and the cloud. IoT devices are typically embedded with technology, such as sensors and software, and can include mechanical and digital machines and consumer objects.

These devices encompass everything from everyday household items to complex industrial tools. Increasingly, organizations in various industries are using IoT to operate more efficiently, deliver enhanced customer service, improve decision-making and increase the value of the business.

With IoT, data is transferable over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interactions.

A thing in the internet of things can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low, or any other natural or human-made object that can be assigned an Internet Protocol address and can transfer data over a network.
